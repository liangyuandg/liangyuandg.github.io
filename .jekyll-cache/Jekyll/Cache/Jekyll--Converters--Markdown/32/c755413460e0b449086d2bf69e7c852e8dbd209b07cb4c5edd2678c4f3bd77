I"f<p>I believe the power of computing and AI can shape the future of healthcare.
By working closely with physicians, I develop AI algorithms, and build AI-empowered systems that can either (1) enable physician’s faster and more accurate diagnosis, or (2) increase patient’s understanding about his/her health and treatments.</p>

Patient-physician communication is a core requirement of patient-centered care.
Due to the complexity of dental surgeries and patient-dentist gap of expertise, conventional techniques are usually not effective for explaining surgical steps.
As such, we developed the first interactive tool that enables 3D demonstration of dental surgeries to promote patients’ understanding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Algorithm:</em></strong>
To reflect patient’s condition from common imaging, we developed the first CNN for the 3D reconstruction of dental structure from 2D X-ray.
The unique challenge is that shapes and spatial localization of multiple objects (teeth) should be estimated from their 2D projection.
To tackle, we decomposed the task into sub-tasks of teeth segmentation and patch-wise object reconstruction, and developed a random sampling strategy for the end-to-end optimization of CNN.</p>

<p><strong><em>System:</em></strong>
We developed the tool with virtual dental instruments that are simple to operate and illustrative with real-time effects on reconstructed dental models.
The tool was implemented using OpenGL, JavaScript and three.js, and can run readily inside a modern browser.</p>

A physician is required to write a comprehensive and accurate report describing all the findings for each study, which is essentially time consuming.
To solve the problem, we developed the interactive tool that largely reduces reporting time (by up to 50%) with two key techniques:
(1) the automatic awareness of anatomies, and (2) the embedding of a medical knowledge graph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Algorithm:</em></strong>
Automatic anatomy awareness enables a physician to interactively input a finding by clicking the region of interest on the study, and pre-fill certain report contents.
Existing anatomical segmentation CNNs are not robust to image variations caused by pathology and different scanning setups.
To tackle the issue, we proposed a general method to increase the robustness of CNNs with underlying anatomical invariances—incorporating probabilistic atlas priors as explicit constraints for predictions over a locally-connected Conditional Random Field.
The method achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on two brain segmentation benchmarks with significantly boosted robustness.</p>

<p><strong><em>System:</em></strong>
We developed the generic tool in C++ and performed user testing.
A physician can input a finding by simply clicking the location, selecting a template with predefined entries and options, and making selection for most of time.
The tool collects all filled templates for a study, and automatically converts them into a readable medical report based on the knowledge graph.</p>
