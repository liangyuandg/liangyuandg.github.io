I"<p>I believe the power of computing and AI can shape the future of healthcare.
By working closely with physicians, I develop AI algorithms, and build AI-empowered systems that can either (1) enable physician’s faster and more accurate diagnosis, or (2) increase patient’s understanding about his/her health and treatments.
I am passionate about designing and implementing such systems for deployment and commercialization.</p>

<p>Patient-physician communication is a core requirement of patient-centered care, which brings higher satisfaction about treatments and better health outcomes.
Due to the complexity of dental surgeries and patient-dentist gap of expertise, conventional techniques are usually not effective for explaining surgical steps.
As such, we developed the first interactive tool that enables 3D demonstration of dental surgeries to promote patients’ understanding.</p>
