I"S<h4 id="about-me">About Me</h4>
<p>My name is Yuan Liang. I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
I am doing research in <a href="http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/">Design Automation Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/faculty.html">Dr. Lei He</a>.
I also work closely with <a href="https://xac.is/">Dr. Anthony Chen</a> from <a href="https://hci.ucla.edu/#projects">UCLA Human Computer Interaction Research (HCI Research)</a> and <a href="http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/kun-wang/index.html">Dr. Kun Wang</a>.
My research focuses on computer vision algorithm and application for medical data, and intersects with natural language programming.
My goal is to develop AI-empowered tools for intelligent healthcare.</p>
