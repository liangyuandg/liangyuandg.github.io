I"…<p>I believe the power of computing and AI can shape the future of healthcare.
By working closely with physicians, I build AI-empowered systems that can either (1) enable physicianâ€™s faster and more accurate diagnosis, or (2) increase patientâ€™s understanding about his/her health and treatments.
I am passionate about designing and implementing such systems for deployment and commercialization.</p>
