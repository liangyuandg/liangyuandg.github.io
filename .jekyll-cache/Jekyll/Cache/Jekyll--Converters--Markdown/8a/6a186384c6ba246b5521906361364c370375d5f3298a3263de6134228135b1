I"•<p>I believe the power of computing and AI can shape the future of healthcare.
By working closely with physicians, I develop AI algorithms, and build AI-empowered systems that can either (1) enable physicianâ€™s faster and more accurate diagnosis, or (2) increase patientâ€™s understanding about his/her health and treatments.</p>

Patient-physician communication is a core requirement of patient-centered care.
Due to the complexity of dental surgeries and patient-dentist gap of expertise, conventional techniques are usually not effective for explaining surgical steps.
As such, we developed the first interactive tool that enables 3D demonstration of dental surgeries to promote patientsâ€™ understanding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Algorithm:</em></strong>
To reflect patientâ€™s condition from common imaging, we developed the first CNN for the 3D reconstruction of dental structure from 2D X-ray.
The unique challenge is that shapes and spatial localization of multiple objects (teeth) should be estimated from their 2D projection.
To tackle, we decomposed the task into sub-tasks of teeth segmentation and patch-wise object reconstruction, and developed a random sampling strategy for the end-to-end optimization of CNN.</p>

<p><strong><em>System:</em></strong>
We developed the tool with virtual dental instruments that are simple to operate and illustrative with real-time effects on reconstructed dental models.
The tool was implemented using OpenGL, JavaScript and three.js, and can run readily inside a modern browser</p>

A physician is required to write a comprehensive and accurate report describing all the findings for each study, which is essentially time consuming.
To solve the problem, we developed the interactive tool that largely reduces reporting time (by up to 50%) with two key techniques:
(1) the automatic awareness of anatomies, and (2) the embedding of a medical knowledge graph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Algorithm:</em></strong>
The physician can interactively input a finding by selecting the region of interest on the study.</p>
