I"˜<p>I believe the power of computing and AI can shape the future of healthcare.
By working closely with physicians, I develop AI algorithms, and build AI-empowered systems that can either (1) enable physicianâ€™s faster and more accurate diagnosis, or (2) increase patientâ€™s understanding about his/her health and treatments.</p>

<p>Patient-physician communication is a core requirement of patient-centered care.
Due to the complexity of dental surgeries and patient-dentist gap of expertise, conventional techniques are usually not effective for explaining surgical steps.
As such, we developed the first interactive tool that enables 3D demonstration of dental surgeries to promote patientsâ€™ understanding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Algorithm:</em></strong>
To reflect patientâ€™s condition from common imaging, we developed the first CNN for the 3D reconstruction of dental structure from 2D X-ray.
The unique challenge is that shapes and spatial localization of multiple objects (teeth) should be estimated from their 2D projection.
To tackle, we decompose the task into sub-tasks of teeth segmentation and patch-wise object reconstruction, and develop a random sampling for the end-to-end optimization of CNN.</p>
