#### About Me    
My name is Yuan Liang. I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
I am doing research in [Design Automation Laboratory](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by [Dr. Lei He](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/faculty.html).
I also work closely with [Dr. Anthony Chen](https://xac.is/) from [UCLA Human Computer Interaction Research (HCI Research)](https://hci.ucla.edu/#projects), [Dr. Kun Wang](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/kun-wang/index.html), and [Dr. JP Dym](https://www.jpdym.net/) from Nines Radiology.
My research is focused on computer vision algorithms for medical data, and their applications with the consideration of human-AI interaction.
<!-- I am passionate about developing AI-empowered medical systems for deployment/commercialization. -->
